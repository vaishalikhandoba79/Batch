operators:-
***********
- operators are spacial type of symbols used to perform some operations
on operands.

ex: -  2(operand1)*(symbol)3(operand2)

- unary 
- binary
- ternary

1. arithmatic operator:-
**************************
+ , - , * , / , % ,** , ++ , --
concatenation :- joinign of two or more string
typecasting:- changing one data type into another dattype.
NaN :- Not a number :- it is a specail type of number which is not leagl in javascript.
 

 increment :- 
        1.pre-increment :- it will increment the value by one before execution
        2.post-increment :- it will increment the value by one after executuion.

assignment operator:-
= , += , -= , /= , %= , *= 
let a =10;
clg(a+5)

relational operators:-
***********************
- relational operators always return boolean values.
== , === , != , !==(strictly not equals) , > , >= , < , <=

what is different between "==" & "===" ?(FAQ)
- "==" it will check only the values not the datatypes.
- "===" it will check both values and datatypes.


logical operators:-
*******************
 AND(&&) - it will return true only when both side conditions are true else return false
 OR(||) - it will return true when both side is true as well as anyone side is true else false.
 NOT(!) - it will make true as falsa and false as true.

 decision making statements:-
 ****************************
 if :- if block will execute only when the condition is true.
 - we can give only one condition for if 
 if-else :- if we ewant to display either of true / false we use if else block.
 - this also works with one condition.
 else if ladder
 switch
 ternery condition

 looping statements:-
 *********************
- looping statements are used to iterate the block of codes multiple times.
 1.for loop :- 
 -minimum iteration count of forloop is "0".
 syntax :-  for(initialization ; condition; updation)
                        {
                                //statemets
                        }
 2.while loop
 - minimum iteration count of while loop is "0".
 syntax :-  while(condition){
                        //statement
                        updation
                }
 3.do-while loop
 - minimum iteration count of d-while lool is "1".
 synatx :- do{
                //statements
                }while(condition)

- what are the entry controlled loop and exit controlled loop?
- for loop & while loops are entry controlled loops.
- do-while is a exit controlled loop.


functions:-
***********
- function is a block of code used to perform specific task.
- functions can be reuse for n number of times.
- functions are non-primitive data types.

syntax :- function function_name(optional parameters) // function declatration
                {
                      //statements  
                }
                function_name(arguments);//function calling/invoking

note :- without calling the function the function body will never execute.

types of functions:-
********************
1.named function :- function which is having a name to decalre and to invoke(calling).
2.anonymus function:-function which doesnot have a name for declare.
- anonymus function cannot be executed independently.
3.function expression:- function decalration is assigned as a value to variable 
        and the same function will be invoked with the help of variable.
4.immediate invoke function expression(IIFE):- once the function is created immedialtely it should be invoked.
        - iife can be executed for only one time.
5.Arrow function:- to concise the syntax of normal function.
synatx :-  ()=>{};
- it is also similar to anonymus function.

6.higher order function:-
- higher order function is a function which accepts another function as a 
value/argument to its parameter and returns a functions as a output.

7.callback function:-
- callback function is a function which is passed as a value/argumnets to 
another function.

-closure :- closure is a memory created when functions bundled together/functions nested each other
        by giving accessibility to the innermost function to access the variables of outermost function.
 - closure is a memory which gives accessibility to access the variables of outermost function from innermost function.

Note:- current version of javascript - es14.
es - ECMA script 
ECMA - european computer manufacturing association

return statement:-
- it will return either expression or variables to future use.

implicit return :- returns without using a "return" keyword manually.

explicit return :- returns using "return" keyword manually

Arrays:- 
********
- Array can store mulitple values within a single variable.
- collections of items / values.
- array can store homogenous values and heterogenous values.
syntax :-  [] 

ex :-  


map and forEach difference
map:- it is used to iterrate the values of an array one by one.
- it will return new Array from original array.

forEach :- it is sued to iterate the values of an array.
- if we return the value we will get "undefined".

methods in array:-
******************
push() , pop() , unshift() , shift() , reverse() , join()
concat()

what is object ?
- object is an entity which is used to store the values in the form of key &value pairs.
- Object is a physical entity which is having states(properties) and behaviours(method).

syntax :-  let obj = {};

notes: - Object based language  + OOPs

ex:-    let obj ={
                name:"Sam",
                age:25
                }

JSON :- Javascript object notation
- IT is used to transmit the data from client to server and server to client.

syntax :-  {
                "key":"value"
        }


- for json no need to store it inside variable
- both keys and values shoyuld be double quoted only except number.

ex:- {
    "name":"Sam",
    "age":25
}

extension for json file is ".json"
